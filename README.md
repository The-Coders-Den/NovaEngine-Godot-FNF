# 🎮 Friday Night Funkin: Nova Engine

A new engine made in the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/), (specifically 4.1+) built for good performance,
moddability, and quality of life.

> [!Note]
> This engine is a ***passion*** project, which means i may not work on it for long periods of time, or won't add certain features.
> 
> When contributing to the engine, please make sure to ask permission before adding a feature. Otherwise bugfix/patch commits are perfectly allowed.

> [!Important]
> It should also be noted that you should have a bit of experience with Godot before trying Nova out,
> Go check out some tutorials, make some small games, anything to kickstart your Godot knowledge!
>
> Also use **ParallaxNode** instead of **ParallaxLayer** when making stages
> because **ParallaxLayer** acts weird with camera zooms.

# ℹ️ Features
Here's a list of some of the features this engine has to offer:

- ✅ Vanilla weeks from 1 to 7
- ✅ Easy Modding
- ✅ Easily replaceable menus (Thanks to Godot being a more GUI focused game engine)
- ✅ Good Performance
- ✅ Easy to combine 2D & 3D elements
- ✅ Modcharts can use any node/class/function inside of Godot
- ✅ Character offsets cannot be affected by scale, rotation, or playing as opponent instead of player/vice versa
- ❌ Discord RPC (soon though :3)
